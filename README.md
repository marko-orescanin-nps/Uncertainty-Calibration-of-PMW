Included Jupyter notebook demonstartes usage of the Bayesian Neural Network model via MC Droopout to produce regression predictions and repeat some of the results from the publication. 

Model checkpoint and data records are publically available at https://nps.box.com/s/lxmgiyb04h3nl17fyd6f32vuyeq57z70
